    <h2>Software Engineering Experts' Panel: The Status and Future of SBSE in the Software Engineering Community</h2>
	
	<p>We are very pleased to announce a special panel discussion as part of the symposium program.  
	Five world-leading experts on software engineering will discuss the current state of search-based software engineering 
	research, identify challenges to the research agenda, and assess the potential impact of SBSE on software engineering practice.  
	</p>
	<p>The panellists are:</p>

	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/~norman/">Norman Fenton</a>, Professor of Computer Science, Queen Mary, 
	University of London, UK</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/A.Finkelstein">Anthony Finkelstein</a>, Professor of Software Systems Engineering, 
	University College London, UK</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.di.univaq.it/inverard/paola.html">Paola Inverardi</a>, Professor of Computer Science, Universit&agrave;  dell'Aquila, Italy</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~soffa/">Mary Lou Soffa</a>, Owen R. Cheatham Professor, University of Virginia, 
	USA</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~ifs/">Ian Sommerville</a>, Professor of Software Engineering, 
	University of St Andrews, UK</li>
	</ul>

	<p>We envisage that the discussion led by this distinguished panel will help to inform the direction that the 
	SBSE community takes as it continues to grow and mature.  Position statements from the panellists will be 
	published on the on this website in advance of the symposium as well as in the conference proceedings.  
	We encourage attendees to participate in this discussion at the symposium itself, and through the submission of fast 
	abstracts detailing their positions on key SBSE themes.</p>

	<h2>Call for Fast Abstracts</h2>

	<p>We invite the submission of Fast Abstracts to the symposium.  Fast Abstracts are short papers that describe either: </p>

	<ul>
	<li>research in progress that has yet to be fully developed and validated; or,</li>
	<li>opinions on important and controversial themes in search based software engineering.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Fast Abstracts should not exceed 2 pages in the IEEE proceedings format, and will be reviewed for relevance, 
	soundness, ability to stimulate discussion, and novelty.  Contributions should be original work that has not been 
	submitted elsewhere, but authors will retain copyright.  Accepted contributions will be allocated a 10 minute presentation 
	at the symposium, and will be published on the SSBSE 2009 website.</p>

	<p>Schedule:</p>

	<p>Fast Abstract submission by: <strong>20 April 2009</strong>.</p>
	<p>Fast Abstract acceptance notification: <strong>30 April 2009</strong>.</p>
