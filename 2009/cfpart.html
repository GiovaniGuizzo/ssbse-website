	<p>We invite you to participate in the 1st International Symposium on Search Based Software Engineering &#8212; SSBSE 2009.</p>

	<p>SSBSE 2009 is the inaugural meeting of an annual symposium dedicated to Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE). The symposium's objective is to build on the recent flourishing of interest in SBSE by 
	not only creating a welcoming forum for discussion and dissemination, but also by establishing a regular event that will 
	strengthen the rapidly growing international community.</p>

	<p>The venue for SSBSE 2009 is Cumberland Lodge, a beautiful and historic royal residence in the heart of Windsor Great Park with
	 world-class conference facilities. The Lodge is close to London, and only a short taxi ride from Heathrow Airport, yet is
	 surrounded by some of the finest parkland in the country.</p>

	<p>Registration for the symposium is now open. The registration fee covers not only attendance at the symposium, but also 		accommodation and meals at Cumberland Lodge.  For details, please see the <a href="register.html">registration page</a>.</p>
