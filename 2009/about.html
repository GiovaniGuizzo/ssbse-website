<p><b>SSBSE 2009</b> launches an annual symposium dedicated to <a href="aboutsbse.html">Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE)</a>.  The objective is to build on and sustain the recent flourishing of interest in the SBSE field.  
We believe that this annual event will greatly benefit the rapidly growing international community.</p>

    <p>We intend to establish SSBSE as the premier dedicated SBSE event. By bringing together researchers and practitioners, 
the symposium is designed to not only act as a forum for dissemination and discusssion, but also to encourage collaboration 
and strengthen the community.</p>

    <p>SSBSE 2009 will be held from May 13<sup>th</sup> to 15<sup>th</sup>, 2009.  The venue is 
<a href="venue.html">Cumberland Lodge</a>, a beautiful and historic former royal residence in the heart of Windsor Great Park 
that boasts world-class conference facilities.  Despite being close to London and only 20 minutes' taxi ride from 
Heathrow Airport, the Lodge is surrounded by some of the finest parkland in the country.</p>

    <p>The symposium program includes three <a href="keynote.html">keynote speakers</a> who are internationally renowned 
leaders in their research fields: David E Goldberg, Lionel C Briand, and Enrique Alba.</p>

    <p>The SSBSE proceedings will be published by Conference Publishing Services, and extended versions of selected papers will appear in 
a <a href="specialissue.html">special issue of Empirical Software Engineering</a>.  The symposium is supported by the 
UK research council and <a href="sponsors.html">industrial sponsorship</a>.</p>
