	<p>We invite the submission of Fast Abstracts to the symposium.  Fast Abstracts are short papers that describe either: </p>

	<ul>
	<li>research in progress that has yet to be fully developed and validated; or,</li>
	<li>opinions on important and controversial themes in search based software engineering.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Fast Abstracts should not exceed 2 pages in the IEEE CS proceedings format, and will be reviewed for relevance, 
	soundness, ability to stimulate discussion, and novelty.  Contributions should be original work that has not been 
	submitted elsewhere, but authors will retain copyright.  Accepted contributions will be allocated a 10 minute presentation 
	at the symposium, and will be published on the SSBSE 2009 website.</p>

	<p>Fast Abstract submission by: <strong>20 April 2009</strong>.</p>
