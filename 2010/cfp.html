    <h3>About The Symposium</h3>

	<p>We are pleased to announce SSBSE 2010, the second edition of the annual symposium dedicated to Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE). The symposium's objective is to build on the recent flourishing of interest in SBSE by not only creating a welcoming forum for discussion and dissemination, but also by establishing a regular event that will strengthen the rapidly growing international community. The venue for SSBSE 2010 is Benevento, Italy. Benevento is located in the south of the country, 230 km southeast of Rome, 80 km northeast of Naples, and is easily accessible by train from both cities. </p>
	
    <h3>Technical Track</h3>

<p>We invite the submission of high quality papers describing original and significant work in all aspects of Search Based Software Engineering, including theoretical work, research on SBSE applications, empirical studies, and reports from industrial experience. Applications may be drawn from throughout the software engineering lifecycle. Search methods may include, but are not limited to, operational research techniques and optimization methods inspired by nature, such as evolutionary algorithms and simulated annealing. We particularly encourage papers that use novel search techniques and describe software engineering applications to which SBSE has not previously been applied.</p>

	<h3>Format And Submission</h3>

<p>Papers must not have been previously published nor have been submitted to, or be in consideration for, any journal, book, or other conference. Papers will be evaluated by members of the program committee based on their originality, technical soundness and quality of presentation. Papers must conform to the CPS proceedings paper format guidelines, and must be no more than 10 (ten) pages in length. If the paper is accepted, at least one author is expected to attend the conference and to present the paper. Accepted papers will appear in proceedings published by the Conference Publishing Services (CPS). Further information on paper formatting and submission will be available from the symposium website, <a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}">{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}</a>.</p>

<h3>PhD Student Track</h3>

<p>We also invite papers for a special PhD student track that will provide a venue for students to present their work and receive feedback from senior members of the SBSE research community.  PhD papers may include thesis plans, proposed research, as well as partial or complete SBSE research results already obtained.  Papers should clearly state the stage at which the candidate is at in their PhD (i.e. number of years of study completed), and should be no more than 4 pages using the regular conference format. Each paper will be reviewed by selected members of the program committee. To be eligible a student must be registered on a doctoral program and must not yet have made their final dissertation defense.</p>

<h3>Fast Abstract Track</h3>

<p>Fast abstracts feature novel ideas, not yet fully developed or validated. Fast abstracts should be longer no more than 2 pages in the CPS proceedings paper format, and will be reviewed for relevance, soundness, ability to stimulate discussion, and originality. Accepted fast abstracts will be presented at the symposium and published online on the conference website.</p>

<h3>Special Issue</h3>

<p>The authors of selected symposium papers will be invited to submit extended versions for a special issue of Information and Software Technology journal (IST) edited by Elsevier.</p>
