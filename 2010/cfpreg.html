    <h2>CALL FOR PAPERS - SSBSE 2010</h2>
    
    <p>We invite the submission of high quality papers describing original and significant work in all aspects of search based software engineering, including theoretical work, research on SBSE applications, empirical studies, and reports from industrial experience. Applications may be drawn from all aspect of the software engineering lifecycle. Search methods may include, but are not limited to, operational research techniques and optimisation methods inspired by nature, such as evolutionary algorithms and simulated annealing. We particularly encourage papers that describe software engineering applications to which SBSE has not previously been applied, but also welcome papers that address development of existing application areas.</p>

	<p>Papers must not have been previously published nor have been submitted to, or be in consideration for, any journal, book, or other conference. Papers will be evaluated by members of the program committee based on their originality, technical soundness and quality of presentation. Papers must conform to the CPS proceedings paper format guidelines, and must be limited to 10 pages. If the paper is accepted, at least one author is expected to attend the conference and to present the paper.</p>
