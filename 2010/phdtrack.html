title: "PhD Student Track"
---
    
    <p>
    We also invite papers for a special PhD student track that will provide a venue for students to present their work and receive feedback from senior members of the SBSE research community.  PhD papers may include thesis plans, proposed research, as well as partial or complete SBSE research results already obtained.  Papers should clearly state the stage at which the candidate is at in their PhD (i.e. number of years of study completed), and should be no more than 4 pages using the regular conference format. Each paper will be reviewed by selected members of the program committee. To be eligible a student must be registered on a doctoral program and must not yet have made their final dissertation defense.
