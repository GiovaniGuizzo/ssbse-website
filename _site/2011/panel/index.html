                <p>
                    Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) reformulates software engineering tasks as optimization problems.

                    The objective becomes that of locating, from among all possible solutions to the problem, one that is sufficiently
                    good according to an appropriate fitness metric. This reformulation enables previously manually intensive tasks to 
                    be partially or fully automated, solves problems that are intractable by other methods, and often leads to 
                    innovative and insightful solutions... <a href="about.html">more »</a></p>
